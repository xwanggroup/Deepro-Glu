Title: Deepro-Glu Combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Bi-LSTM Models Using ProtBert and Biological Features to Identify Lysine Glutarylation Sites



![The Model Architecture](https://github.com/zydingg/Deepro-Glu/blob/main/Deepro-Glu.png)
    
### Deepro_Glu uses the following dependencies:
* python 3.6 
* pytorch 
* scikit-learn
* numpy


### Guiding principles:
* File 'data' contains training and testing data used in this study.
* File 'code' contains scripts for training the model and loading data. Load_data.py is the implementation of load raw protein sequence. Deepro_Glu.py was used to training the proposed model. utils.py is the implementation of calculate training model score.
* File 'result' contains model test result. test.py is the implementation of calculate model test result.
